
## INNER GAME:  ATTITUDES FOR PROBLEM SOLVING


#### Ask yourself: Am I the type of person that is being reslient? 


#### You need to have the attitude that the problem that you are doing can be solved.
	- Belief system:  There is a way to make this work.


#### I'm willing to persist until the solution can be released.
	- Most of problem-solving is persistence.  You have to persist when things get hard.


#### The problem may not always be solved in the desired time frame.
	- The reality is different from the expectation.
	- Missed deadlines are "red flags"
	- Time deadlines are targets to aim at.


#### Spend alot of time in the Abyss.  
	-Find joy in the process.  Reject frustration. Accept the challenge.  Change your approach.
	-Each problem is an opportunity for growth.
	-Each problem is a new opportunity for self-discovery and ask God for improvement.


#### Knowledge of these principles is not enough.  In your journal, see if you are on track.


## OUTTER GAME:  PROBLEM SOLVING IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

#### Build a feature that does not exist.

#### Improve an existing functionality.
	- Write things down on paper.
	- Define the objective as clearly as possible.
	- When encountering bugs, clearly define what the desired result is.
	

#### Small-chunking.  Do a little bit of work at a time.
	Take a complex problem and break it down until you cannot break it down any further.
		- Once you have problem one task down, focus on that one task like a bulldog.


#### Learn how to ask for help.
	When asking a question, think about the needs of the person answering the question.
		- Don't be selfish
		- Don't forget code
		- Do not have poorly defined problem
	Make it easy to solve your problem
		- Provide context (what system and technology stack as your using)
		- Completely define desired outcome / Completely define actual outcome
		- Give relevant information (ie console errors, stack traces)
		- Be concise.  Respect people's time.
	Key things to remember:
		1.  Demonstrate effort.  People are willing to help people who are trying.
		2.  Your helper does not have to dig.
		3.  Show respect (think about the other person.  Say 'Thank you.')
